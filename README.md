## 🎮 About the Game

**Jungle Warfair** is a tactical combat game set in dense, procedurally generated jungle environments. Command your squad through hostile terrain, manage resources, and outmaneuver enemies hidden beneath a canopy that hides as many dangers as your opponents do.

- 🌿 **Dynamic jungle environments** — terrain, weather, and wildlife all affect combat
- 🧠 **Tactical squad AI** — give orders and let your team execute
- 🔫 **Deep weapon & gear systems** — every loadout decision matters
- 🗺️ **Procedural map generation** — no two missions are the same
- 🛠️ **Built from the ground up for modding**

---
